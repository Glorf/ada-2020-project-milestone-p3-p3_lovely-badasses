# Snowden's revelations 

In June 2013, Snowden reveals to the whole world shocking news about the U.S. government : the NSA is spying on the web traffic of the entire world ! This makes the headline of every newspaper in the world, everybody is talking about it. How should they behave on the Internet now that they know every one of their searches is being collected ? Let's dive into some Wikipedia and Google searches data to find out **how** they actually behaved.



# Let's start our investigation...

We need to ask ourselves a question first : what articles might people be chilled to look up after such revelations ? Well, probably the articles related to terrorism questions, because the government is tracking these people. So let's analyze the number of Wikipedia views per months for these articles.

TODO insert graph of the first time period to the left, and a short comment on it to the right.
Make an option to change the visualization to the second period 

{% include fig1.html %}
> Make the comment on the right
> In this style, it's cool


# Interestingâ€¦ but is that all there is ?

We should not stop here, what if one article has a so huge number of views that it impacts the trend ? Let's look at the list of every topic and highlight their importance. 

![Terrorism wordcloud]({{ site.url }}/assets/pwc_t.jpg)

TODO insert World Cloud picture here, maybe interactive like when we hover over a word, there is the percentage of participation in the trend, or the total number of views, or the mean number of views per week/month, etc...


#  Snowden's revelations, not the only big news

There are so many world's events that happen everyday, we cannot be sure that the chilling effect observed was due to the revelations of Snowden of 2013. Of course that the Wikipedia views will be affected by external world's event. Let's have a look at them.

TODO insert here circular plot of the external events calendar, ideally when we hover over a case it explains in one line what the event is.


# Now are we still chilling ?

Now we reproduce the same figure as the first one, but without all the external events that disrupt the general trend. Do we still have chilling effect ? The suspense is at its peak...

TODO insert figure of the new regression, maybe adding a functionality that allows the reader to discover the image by themselves, if you know what i mean. 

TODO write conclusion here depending of our results

Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo

*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
